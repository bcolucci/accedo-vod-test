# Video On Demand - Specifications

Build a simple Media App VOD (Video On-Demand) application that keeps track of
a list of videos the user has watched.

## Application Features

[X] The application should display a list of videos in a horizontal carousel on the
home page, which should be scrollable.

[X] The user should be able to select a video to play in full screen.

[X] When the video is finished, the application should go back to the previous
page.

[X] The application UI must be responsive to changes in the browser window /
screen sizes. You do not need to implement a mobile view but it should at
least adjust based on the desktop browser width.

[X] The application should be navigable by both the mouse and keyboard, i.e.
navigate using the arrow keys and enter to select.

[X] The user should be able to see a list of videos they have previously
watched.

## Advanced Add-on Features

[X] Adding lazy load functionality in your carousel

[X] Implementing multiple carousels in categories

[X] Implementing movie information popup window

[ ] Anything else you can think of

## Requirements

[X] The server component should be developed in NodeJS / MongoDB.

[X] Data transferred between the server and client side should be in JSON
format.

[X] The app should follow the design template illustrated on the next page.

[X] The app should work in the latest versions of the most popular browsers
(Chrome / Firefox etc.).

Suggested tools (but not required):
* Chrome Developer Tools (for debugging)
* Frameworks such as React, Express, Angular, Bootstrap, Sass
* Build tools such as Grunt, Gulp, Webpack

[X] The app should be developed entirely in HTML / JavaScript / SASS, as a
single page application (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application).

[X] The app should be controllable by the arrow keys (to navigate) and enter
(to select). Mouse support is also required.

[X] The viewing history should be saved on a server and persisted across
browsing sessions. That is, if the user refreshes the browser the history
should be automatically loaded. User authentication is not necessary.

[X] Detailed instructions about how to set up the app and server are required. A
live demo hosted on a publicly-accessible server is highly regarded; for
example AWS, Heroku, OpenShift.

[ ] If you are using any cloud solutions to host or develop your application,
credential(s) should be provided.

[X] Functioning unit tests should be provided with the source code (Mocha /
Chai / Jest).

## Extra Credits

[X] Comment the code nicely

[X] Provide a Docker image

[~] 100% unit test coverage

[ ] Make it beautiful

## Delivery

[X] Your implementation of the Media App VOD application should preferably be
provided in a private Github repository (or in a compressed archive), containing
all necessary files and resources.

[X] Also, instructions on how to install and start the app are expected,
preferably in a ReadMe file.
